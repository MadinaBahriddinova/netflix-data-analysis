#  Netflix Data Analysis with Python

This project explores and visualizes data from Netflix’s catalog of movies and TV shows using Python, pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.

## Overview

I used a dataset from Kaggle containing ~6,000 Netflix titles to analyze trends in content types, countries, popular directors, and the years content was added.

The goal was to:
- Practice data cleaning and exploration
- Visualize patterns and trends in Netflix's content
- Strengthen my data analysis and portfolio

## Dataset

- Source: [Netflix Movies and TV Shows on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows)
- Columns: Title, Director, Cast, Country, Date Added, Release Year, Rating, Duration, etc.

## Tools & Libraries

- **Python**
- **pandas** – data manipulation
- **matplotlib** & **seaborn** – visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab** – development environment

---

## Key Insights

-  Netflix has more **Movies** than **TV Shows**
-  Most content comes from the **United States**
-  Peak content addition was in **2019–2020**
-  **Top 10 directors** include big names with multiple titles on the platform

## What I Learned

- Cleaning real-world messy data (missing values, type conversion)
- Using `.loc` and `.fillna()` safely
- Creating clear, insightful charts
- Writing Python code for real data projects

---

## Next Steps

- Build a Power BI dashboard version of this analysis
- Expand to include genre analysis and viewer ratings
- Do comparative studies with Amazon Prime or Disney+ data
